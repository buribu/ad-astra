You can add new tech here simply by creating a text file with the ".tech" extension.

Markup below is case-sensitive (<name> works, <NAME> does not). Bad markup will usually lead the parser to print a complaint and not load your tech.

Required:
<name>Foo</name> - display name of tech
<fiid>Foo</fiid> - fixed internal ID of tech (guaranteed not to change even if display name is changed for some reason, to avoid prereq problems)
<cost>100</cost> - tech points required to research this tech

Optional:
<tags>PHYSICS;ENERGY;WEAPON</tags> - semicolon-separated list of tags for this tech (can make up arbitrary ones... so be careful not to typo)
<pers>attack add 5; range add 1</pers> - semicolon-separated list of effects on characters to whom this tech is applied
<ship>attack add 10</ship> - semicolon-separated list of effects on ships to which this tech is applied
<empi>mining add 10</empi> - semicolon-separated list of effects on empires to which this tech is applied


For <pers> <ship> and <empi>, valid numerical operators are "add" "subtract" and "set". Numerical values should be integers.
